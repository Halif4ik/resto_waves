# Test_Tasks Back End 
## Description:
This project serves as the back end for a test task. It provides various API endpoints for managing sneakers, models, 
and brands. The application is built using NestJS, a powerful framework for building scalable and maintainable 
server-side applications.
I used for check on this endpoint- http://localhost:3010/.

## Installation:
Before running the application, create a .env file with the necessary environment variables, as specified in the sample 
file. Then, install the dependencies and start the application:
```
yarn install

nest start --watch
```
## Creating an Initial Migration:
To create an initial migration, execute the following command:
For create empty migration for handler contains execute next command:
```
typeorm migration:create ./src/migrations/init
```
This will generate a new migration file in the "migrations" directory named {TIMESTAMP}-sneakersDiment.ts. You can then
run this migration to create the necessary tables:
```
npm run migration:generate -- src/migrations/sneakersDiment
```
Applying Migrations:
To apply the migrations and create the tables in the database, run:
```
yarn run migration:run
```
Reverting Migrations:
If needed, you can revert the migrations and remove the tables by running:
```
yarn run migration:revert
```
## API Endpoints:
